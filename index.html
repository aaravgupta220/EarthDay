    <h1>CLIMATE ACTION</h1>

    <div class = "earth">
        <p>Fifty years ago, the first Earth Day started an environmental revolution. Now, the organisation is igniting an education revolution to save the planet. This formal campaign, launched Summer 2020, is combining grassroots support and on the ground efforts by students, educators, and nonprofits with national level commitments from Ministries of Education and Environment. </p>

    <h1>SCIENCE AND EDUCATION</h1>

    <div class = "science">
        <p>Before social media and the internet, organizers of the first Earth Day in 1970 brought together 20 million people to learn about the environmental problems we faced and act to address them.
            EARTHDAY increases awareness and build environmental and climate literacy in students around the world. The organisation's education program engages hundreds of thousands of teachers, students and partners to educate and inspire the next generation of environmental leaders.</p>

    <h1>PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES</h1>

    <div class = "people">
        <p>Since the first Earth Day in 1970, incredible environmental goals have been achieved. A foodprint measures the environmental impacts associated with the growing, producing, transporting, and storing of our food— from the natural resources consumed to the pollution produced to the greenhouse gases emitted.While we should all be working to reduce our foodprints, there are many factors, including access, affordability, health and culture that help shape our decisions about what we eat. There is not one prescribed diet for everyone. Through this campaign, we want to highlight the different ways individuals and institutions can make an impact on their foodprints.</p>

    <h1>CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION</h1>

    <div class = "and">
        <p>Through climate change, humans have irrevocably upset the balance of nature — now, species are undergoing the greatest extinction rate in more than 60 million years. If we don’t act now, extinction may be humanity’s most enduring legacy.The Conservation and Biodiversity program amplifies and accelerates transformative societal change to restore and protect biodiversity. In a future committed to protecting both wildlife and humanity, this preservation of biodiversity is one of the many solutions to the climate crisis. </p>
